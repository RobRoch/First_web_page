Bootstrap learning

This is my first webpage ever, I was curious about bootstrap3 so decided to build my CV from scratch.
Learned basics about html5, css, javascript, how to read bootstrap3 documentation and how to implement components.

Learning sources:
getbootstrap.com
pluralsight.com
and other.
